    "Sophie Amundsen was on her way home from school. She had walked the first part of the way with Joanna. They had been discussing robots. Joanna thought the human brain was like an advanced computer. Sophie was not certain she agreed. Surely a person was more than a piece of hardware?",
    
    "When they got to the supermarket they went their separate ways. Sophie lived on the outskirts of a sprawling suburb and had almost twice as far to school as Joanna. There were no other houses beyond her garden, which made it seem as if her house lay at the end of the world. This was where the woods began.",

    "She turned the corner into Clover Close. At the end of the road there was a sharp bend, known as Captainâ€™s Bend. People seldom went that way except on the weekend",

    "It was early May. In some of the gardens the fruit trees were encircled withdense clusters of daffodils. The birches were already in pale green leaf." ,
    
    "It was extraordinary how everything burst forth at this time of year! What madethis great mass of green vegetation come welling up from the dead earth as soon as itgot warm and the last traces of snow disappeared?",
    
    "As Sophie opened her garden gate, she looked in the mailbox. There wasusually a lot of junk mail and a few big envelopes for her mother, a pile to dump onthe kitchen table before she went up to her room to start her homework."
